### Slide 3
[`EPL Player.xlsx`] Ucok is an observer of the English Premier League, as he has loved playing soccer since he was a child. He knows many names of English league players because he watches soccer and follows its developments every week. One day, he was invited to be a guest on a sports show on a renowned TV station with the theme "English Soccer Legends." He thought of the idea to discuss the top three forwards based on the number of goals. From the data Ucok has, he knows that Frank Lampard, Gary Speed, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, and Steven Gerrard are midfielders; the rest are forwards. When Ucok fills in on the show, he only has one hour, so he narrows down his discussion to the 2010-2015 seasons. Who are the players Ucok will discuss, and what are their goal totals and playing minutes?
